I have implemented a simple phonebook REST api using node.js. Where name and phone number can't be empty and take input only Bangladeshi phone number.

Database: MongoDB
Server: Mongo Atlas

To run this project:
1. First to install all the package run 'npm install' in the terminal (in the project location)
2. To run the application run 'npm start' in the terminal

To create a new contact (http POST method):
http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/contacts/

To get all the contacts (http GET method):
http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/contacts/

To get a contact (http GET method):
http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/contacts/phoneNo
// replace the phoneNo with the phone you want to update

To Update a contact (http PATCH method):
http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/contacts/id
// replace the id with the _id you want to update

To delete a contact (http DELETE method):
